This is the GitHub repository for our group's Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) assignment for BMEG 423/523. The aim of this CDSS was to achieve early prediction of sepsis in ICU patients, based on vital sign and lab test monitoring data. The training and test datasets used for model development were provided in class and are based on the datasets provided for the [PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/). This repository includes files for our XGBoost CDSS model in addition to statistical analysis of the training dataset.
